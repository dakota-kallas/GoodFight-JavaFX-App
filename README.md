# GoodFight-JavaFX-App
This project was a software system developed for a local non-profit organization, The Good Fight, to handle their bookkeeping needs. The solution was created using the JavaFX GUI framework and a MYSQL database. The software allows for the management of different types of users including Administrators, Donors, Volunteers, and Others.

Administrators have the ability to create, maintain, and manage user accounts, including their own. They also have the ability to perform simple data analysis and generate reports.

Donors are able to make restricted or unrestricted donations and attend events. Volunteers are able to register to help with events and programs.

The software also provides the ability to add, search, modify, and view events and programs, with a graphical user interface consisting of multiple screens for different tasks. This interface includes a welcome screen that displays the different functionalities of the software, as well as separate screens for logging in or registering to the system.

The solution was designed with a focus on ease-of-use and user-friendly navigation, allowing for seamless management of the non-profit's participants and events.

This application was developed for a Software Design semester team project using the 
Agile design process.

**Team members:** _Dakota Kallas, Jack Parker, Chase Roehl, Khrystyna Yadvinska_

**Technologies used:** Java, XML, CSS, MySQL

### How to run:
In order to run the project you must have the JavaFX GUI package installed on your machine.
<br />Once it is installed, you will be able to run the Main.java file in the src/application
directory.
<br />You will then need to setup a localhost database connection on MySQL Workbench using the data
importer of the database dump in the database directory as a new "npdb" schema.
<br />_Note: You will need to match the JDBC connection settings used in the DBUtils.java class._

All project files can be found in the main branch.
