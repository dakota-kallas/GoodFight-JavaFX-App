# GoodFight-JavaFX-App
A bookkeeping software developed for The Good Fight, a non-profit in La Crosse, WI. 
This application was developed for a Software Design semester team project using the 
Agile design process.

**Technologies used:** Java, XML, CSS, MySQL

**Team members:** Dakota Kallas, Jack Parker, Chase Roehl, Khrystyna Yadvinska

**How to run:** 
In order to run the project you must have the JavaFX GUI package installed on your machine.
Once it is installed, you will be able to run the Main.java file in the src/application
directory.
You will then need to setup a localhost database connection on MySQL Workbench using the data
importer of the database dump in the database directory as a new "npdb" schema.
/n_Note: You will need to match the JDBC connection settings used in the DBUtils.java class._

All project files can be found in the main branch.
